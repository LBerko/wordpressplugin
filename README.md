To setup and run the example it would require me (and you) to pay a monthly subscription to WordPress.
However, I will give instructions on how to setup and run the example in a hypothetical situation where the WordPress website
is up and running.

(HOW TO SETUP AND RUN THE 'NUTRITION TRACKER' PLUGIN TO YOUR WORDPRESS WEBSITE)
This is a tutorial on how to add a 'Nutrition Tracker' plugin to a website that has already been started using WordPress.

If you haven't alreaedy created a wordpress website, go to Wordpress.com, log in and choose a domain. Once your domain is chosen, proceed and click 'design from scratch'. This will take you to a base-website, where you will be able to make all the changes you want using WordPress interface on your own. Let's now proceed to the main focus, the plugin.

Go to the www.wordpress.com/wp-admin. From there, you will click plugins on the sidebar,
and search for the name 'Nutrition Tracker', by Lloyd Berko. (This is only hypothetical, as I haven't paid to make this public.)
Once you've done this, you will see 'Nutrition Tracker' pop up on the sidebar.
Click on Nutrition Tracker. You will be taken to a page that has a box that says 'Nutrition tracker', 'Enter calories', etc.
Type into the Nutrition Tracker and Enter Calories boxes. You will see that once you press 'Add to Tracker', the submissed is
saved and in the top left corner it will read 'Added successfully!'. Your submission is logged and will be stored within the
database of the website. You can come back to this information and delete, update, etc whenever you choose. This plugin
can be implemented to any WordPress website.


Thank you!
